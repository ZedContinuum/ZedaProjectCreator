# Zeda Project Creator

To compile this project, you will need to have a GTK Development Environment ready.
Please see your Operating System's of choice reference for getting this setup.

When you are ready to build, you must first compile the resources:
``` make resources
```

After the resources have been built, you can successfully compile the application:
``` make
```

You can now run the Zeda Project Creator by using:
``` ./build/bin/ZedaProjectCreator
```
